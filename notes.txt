things to fix:

- Custom callback to control the res.status sent from server. (see original passport tutorial)
- Make sure posts display when the token refreshes.
- don't call fetchCurrentUser on every single request. maybe a react-router thing can only call fetchCurrentUser on routes where user is needed
